### 2. Registration Page (`/register`)

**File**: `app/register/page.tsx`

**Purpose**: First step of onboarding - connect Shopify store to x402 platform.

**Features**:

- Store information (name, URL, description, admin token)
- Validation and error handling
- Navigation back to home page

**Form Fields**:
1. **Store Name** (optional)

   - Generated in Shopify admin panel

**Data Flow**:
1. User enters Shopify credentials
2. Frontend validates input
3. Frontend sends POST request to backend (`/api/stores`)
4. Backend creates store in database
5. Frontend stores credentials in localStorage
6. User is redirected to `/products` page

**Local Storage Keys**:
- `shop_domain`: Store URL
- `access_token`: Shopify admin token
